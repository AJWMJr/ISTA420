1. The difference between declarative and imperative is the difference between what and how. Imperative requires you to state how to get what you want and declarative simply requires you to state what you want.

2. Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Control Language (DCL)

3. RDMS are databases modeled around relations where each instance of a table is a list of aspects. Human Resources database is simply a database of employees.

4. It adds the third potential state (other than true of false) of being unknown.

5. Canidate Keys enforce entity integrity by specifying which fields in a tuple need to be unique. entity integrity is the aspect of a database that states that each tuple should be unique.

6. Foreign Keys enforce Referintial integrity by constraining values to those appropriate for the given field. Referintial integrity is the aspect of a database that each field should contain an expected type/range of values.

7. A Table

8. Yes, because no rows are copies of another row

9. No, because you can obtain all the information of a single set with only part of the candidate key. To correct this you could split the table into three parts (Owners and Pets)

10. No, Because non-key data is dependant on each other. You would need to create additional identifiers and segment the table to seperate names from states and states from street addresses

11. instance, database, schema, and object

12. Integrity enforced by the tables model is declarative where as integrity enforced by code is procedural
