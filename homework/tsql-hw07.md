4. Rows Between defines delimeters for the frame

5. to rank each row with  respect to others in the window. in order to control the order of the frame.

7. they look ahead or behind the current row based on the value given

8. they grab the first value in a frame or the last value in a frame

9. to aggregate rows in a defined window. to look at the average order total of a customer compared to each individual order

10. a pivot table allows the pivoting of data from a row state to a column state. if you want to look at the total number of orders one customer makes each month

11. a powerset is the set of all subsets of a given set, including the empty set. Grouping sets similiarly creates multiple sets including an empty set
